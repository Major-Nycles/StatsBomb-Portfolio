# James Cronly Association Football Portfolio

This repository contains the R code submitted for assessment for "Mathematical Modelling of Football" at Uppsala University under the tutelage of Dr. David Sumpter.
The code represents three seperate assignments.

1. Visualisation of Luka Modric - World Cup 2018
2. Novel Scouting Metric - Liverpool FC Defender Search
3. Predicting Liverpool FC 2021/22 - Modified Poisson Model

The remaining git repositories on my profile (Major-Nycles) are publicly accessible and can be viewed for examples of coding/modelling proficiency in general. Code and data pertaining to my Doctoral Thesis is generally not viewable here, as much of the work is proprietory and has not been cleared for dissemination.

Presentations on both the football work contained here and select PhD work is available upon request.
